## 2/3rds average problem:

This is a game where a bunch of people are expected to propose a number
between 0 to 100 and the winner is someone whose number is closest to 2/3rds of the average of all the numbers proposed. We need to create a functional google
sheet for this. Atharva's point is to keep the google form open in its editable version. We can display the output on the google sheet. We need to create this 
google form. The game is played for some time and we teach students on the concept of Nash equilibrium. The inutitive idea should be enough without any rigorous proof. 

## Birthday Paradox:

1. We ask everyone to enter their day and month over a google form. It is good to capture this information by giving htem a dropdown menu. Otherwise, they tend to input in a not so readable format. After this, we will display all the information in a random order in a google sheet and then ask them if they are able to see any collisions. This is just to make it fun and keep them engaged. There can be a hidden sheet, which has the entries in the ascending oder. 

2. We then discuss the fact that the collisions are common. We write a code to illustrate this in google sheet itself. 

3. We will now propose the mobile phone storing problem. Where 100 mobile phones are stored in a 10x10 grid. We will ask them to calculate the probability of a collision. Rather, show this by writing a code in python. 

4. We then check this result for 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000 mobile phones and so on. 

5. Motivate the idea of storage where storage, retrival and lookup can all be done in almost constant time.

6. We will conclude with the idea of hashing and introduce some of its variants (if the audience are up to it).

## Greedy Pig

Atharva brought this to our notice. This seems to be an amazing exercise for students to play and figure out what is happening. We can create a google form for this? We will play this a couple of times to understand what script will make it interesting.
